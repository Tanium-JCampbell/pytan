# 2.1.0

[Released](https://github.com/tanium/pytan/releases/tag/2.1.0) on Sep 05 2015 

## bug fixes
* pytan.handler.Handler.deploy_action(): changed to return package object that was created for said action, not the package object that was sourced from
* pytan.handler.Handler._platform_is_6_2(): force a call to pytan.handler.Handler.get_server_version() if self.server_version_dict is not set yet
* pytan.handler.Handler.deploy_action(): fix packages created by Tanium SOAP API when adding an action so that they are hidden from the console. also ensure more of the attributes for the source package are copied into the new package for continuity.
* pytan.handler.Handler._get_package_def(): fix for pytan.handler.Handler.deploy_action() when searching for packages by name -- if using a package that has in the past existed, had actions deployed against it that created hidden packages, then the actual visible package was deleted and re-created with the same name, _get_package_def() would actually target one of the hidden packages. added include_hidden_flag=0 to GetObject call in _get_package_def() to fix this. also added to pytan.handler.Handler.sensor_def() to stem possible similar issues for pytan.handler.Handler.ask_manual()
* in pytan.handler.Handler._parse_versioning(): Added notes re: server_version states and added server_version_bad_states. both checks for server_version will check against server_version_bad_states.

* pytan.binsupport.add_ask_report_argparser(): Add XML option for command line scripts that support export format options for asking reports

  * remove _extract_export_id()
  * remove export_id handling code from get_result_data()
  * add get_result_data_sse(), which explicitly expects an export_id to exist in the XML response
